      <p> After State championship, I went to US nationals.
        I was able to land on an award. I was placed on <u>7th place </u>. With this opportunity,
        I got to travel to San Diego and Nashville Tennessee. Both of the states were beautiful
        especially the <u>Opryland hotel.</u> Here is the picture of it. </p>
